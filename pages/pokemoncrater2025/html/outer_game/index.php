			Hello everyone, it's been a busy couple of days here on Pokemon  in the bugs and errors forum cleaning up all of those pesky issues you BETA players have been reporting.<br />We're glad to say that almost everything reported has been addressed and fixed so be sure to keep us updated if you find anything new and we will look into it as soon as possible.

			The game is now back up after a long awaited maintenance break to fix performance issues. Pokemon  is now faster than it ever has been and runs as smooth as the day it was born.<br />We hope it remains this way and will monitor it's performance intensely. This server upgrade also sees the return of the game servers <i>theta</i> and <i>zeta</i> which some of you may be pleased to see.<br />On a side note, there will be a new event soon so keep an eye out for more news on that.

			Volcanion has now left the maps until we decide to set an event for it. We hope you all enjoyed looking for it and hopefully managed to get yourself one or maybe more than one.<br />There has also been some small changes to the trade system where you can now search through all types of Pok&eacute;mon rather than just one such as Shiny.<br />You can now also see how long ago a Pok&eacute;mon was put up for trade as well as order a search list by most recently added. This will help you pick more efficiently which Pok&eacute;mon you would like to make an offer on.

			Volcanion has been released on the Fire Cave maps for 24 hours!<br />Get it while you can before it disappears into the event vault. It has the same rarity as regular legendary Pok&eacute;mon and can be found in all 6 types; Normal, Dark, Shiny, Shadow, Mystic and Metallic.

			With the increased popularity of v3, we have moved the game to servers which will better suit the game on speed and stability.<br />Thank you to all who stuck with us while we had the downtime during the move of the game.
                  <br /><br />

			IT'S HERE! The public open BETA for v3 is finally ready. we're just doing a little countdown over on our <a href="http://facebook.com/pokemon" target="_BLANK">Facebook</a> to make everyone aware that we're ready to release it and bring together a nice little crowd ready to dive in so get involved and help us spread the word. See you in the game.

                  <br />
			This is the month.<br />v3 is SO close to completion for an open BETA build. We've been working hard to make sure the launch goes smoothly with no problems and while this takes time it also ensures you get the best possible experience with minimal problems.<br />Hopefully the next update will be to tell you it's ready. Thank you all for being patient and sticking with Pok&eacute;mon .
                  <br /><br />

			The time is drawing closer and closer.<br />Here's a quick list of what will not yet be ready for the open BETA of v3:<br />Attack changes for a small number of Pok&eacute;mon - This is because in v3 Pok&eacute;mon will only be able to learn attacks they would usually be able to in their original games so as you may imagine, this is a long and tedious process to implement. Sidequests from TCG region and up are not yet complete and will be during the BETA. The layout changer has been disabled while Blue and Red are adjusted to v3's larger content size so only the default Black is available. And finally, the Event Center is not complete and not necessary for general gameplay yet anyway. More details on the Event Center will be released at a later date.
                  <br /><br />

                  <span class="itemHeader">September 1<sup>st</sup>, 2014:</span>
                  <br />
			Hello all! The Pok&eacute;mon  v3 BETA is taking form day by day. A litter slower than we had hoped but nonetheless, it is on it's way and it's looking great.<br />This is a small announcement to say we estimate it will be complete some time in October for a public open BETA build.<br />While this means it's not the fully complete version of the site, it does bring it to you, our dedicated members, a lot quicker.<br />An update of what will and will not be complete for the BETA will be posted at a later date.<br />For now, to keep your minds at rest, I will say that the list of what's not finished is not even a handful.
                  <br /><br />

			The closed BETA has now ended and we'd like to thank you again, all who joined us for it.<br />We had a lot of positive feedback from you and managed to weed out some small problems as well as better a few features based on your experience.<br />The game is not yet ready for full public release so we will be working on that over the coming time - Cleaning up a few pages, features and overall polishing the game.<br />Keep an eye on our <a href="http://facebook.com/pokemon">Facbook</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/Pokemon_">Twitter</a> for updates on the current closed state of the game.

                  Pok&eacute;mon  has just started it's closed BETA of v3 which brings the split and fresh start from it's previous v2.<br />We hope all of you joining us for this opportunity enjoy this experience and manage to make the most of this time.<br />It is unsure as of yet how long the BETA will be running but we expect roughly two weeks before the game becomes closed again while we check through all feedback and adjust the game for the full public release.<br />A list of helpful tips, news and rules are posted on the in-game dashboard when you log in for those of you taking part.<br />We'd also like to take this time to thank all of you who are helping make v3 become what it is and will be by taking part in this closed BETA.
